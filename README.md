### Description

I wrote this because my Roommate, likes to leave his computer running his MP3's with his screensaver locked, so now I can change his songs, playlist, or stop it completely. It has two Applications, a host and a Client, run the host on the computer that you want to control the winamp on, and run the Client from your computer.
 
### More Info
 
Need to know target IP and the target IP must have the Host Application Running.

I didn't write the WINAMP API but James Crasta did, and I didn't write the Find Files Class but GDuncan Did, I beleive I got both code from PSC.com.

The MP3's Music that you want.

May make your roommate made when you turn on/off the vis, or min/normalize winamp, or stop his music or make it loud or something.
